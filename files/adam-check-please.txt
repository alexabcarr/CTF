Adam Check Please:
I said, "Hey, I'm looking for Casey Connor
Here's my résumé
I'm looking for a part-time job
And I can start today
Well, I heard you needed some help in frozen
With Eric leavin' soon"
My boss shook my hand
And I began that Monday after school
That Monday after school

So thank you kindly
I owe ya, Hy-Vee

Eatin' cold pizza in the break room
Feelin' kinda small
A skinny kid with a crooked tie
My name tag said it all
It said, "Adam, Frozen, 1 Years of service"
Heh, but I felt like a man
And I made it rain when payday came
'Cause that was all I had


So thank you kindly
I owe ya, Hy-Vee
Yeah, I owe ya
Yeah, I owe ya, Hy-Vee
Adam, check please (Ooh)


Na-da-da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, I'll be filling up thе Cool Whip
(Adam, check please)
If thе lines are gettin' long
You know that you can call me
(Adam, check, Adam, check please)
Over the intercom
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Adam, check please (Ooh) (Help is on the way)
Help is on the way (Na-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Help is on the way
Help is on the way (Yeah, I'll be filling up the Cool Whip)
Help is on the way (Adam, check please)
Help is on the way (Na-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Help is on the way (Everything is beautiful)
Help is on the way (Adam, check, Adam, check please) (Cool Whip)
Help is on the way (Yeah, I promise I'm on the way)
Help is on the way
Help is on the way (Everything is beautiful)
And I'll be there in a jiffy


Because stocking shelves was how I learned
To do my level best and take pride in my work
'Cause you never know when it's your turn
To climb the ladder of success
Show the world what you do best
Yeah, you were made for this


Hey, I'm looking for Casey Connor
It seems like yesterday
I paid my dues in frozen foods
And I just wanna say
God bless the helpful smile in every aisle
I couldn't ask for more
And I'm glad I got my first real job
Working in this grocery store
In this grocery store
In this grocery store


So thank you kindly (You mean the world to me)
I owe ya, Hy-Vee
Yeah, I owe ya
(Woo)
(Ooh)

Don't stop until you reach the stars
Climb the ladder of success
Show the world what you do best
Yeah, you were made for this


So chase your passion and not your paycheck
Be proud of what you have
And put in the work until your signature
Becomes an autograph (Oh, oh)
