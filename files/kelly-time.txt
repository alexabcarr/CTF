Kelly Time:
Well, videotapes and ice skates are beautiful things
Like a birthday card for Johnny and a pair of angel wings
You were tryna light a fire, and all you wanted was a match
But you knew I didn't have one, so it was odd that you should ask
No, it wasn't just the plane crash that shook you to the core
But the very thought of losin' her, that made it all worth dyin' for


I'm sorry
I'm sorry

We both washed up on that island, all alone without a friend
Thinkin' you and I were gonna die there, and that would be the end
But as the weeks turned into months, I saw you overcome your fears
And as we became companions, all those months turned into years
When we would talk and talk for hours, you would make sure I felt heard
'Cause you knew what I was sayin' though I never said a word


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?


After fifteen hundred days, you and me escaped to sea
And I knew that you still loved the girl from Memphis, Tennessee
Out there on that lonely ocean, we met a passin' humpback whale
'Cause all the way from Bakersfield, the tide gave us a sail
And just like that, it happened, the waves took me away
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that you lost a friend that day


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?



Well, you and me went on a journey full of tragedy and pain
But I'm grateful I was with you through the sunshine and the rain
And when I wonder where ya are now, I'll probably never know
But my friend, I hope you made it and somehow you finally made it home (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I have an ocean-worth of questions, but if I do know one thing
It's that the sun will rise tomorrow, and who knows what the tide could bring?


Da-da-da-da-da-da, I'll never forget you (Goodbye, my friend)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh


(Hey, hey, hey) Hey, Kelly are you there? Pick up, I know I said I'd be back
And like that, nobody knew where I was at
And all my logic said I would never see you again
After four years of missin' you so bad, but here I am
And now I have to learn to let you go
Even though I love you more than you'll ever know
I'm gettin' used to half a heart and the way things are
But Kelly, I never should've gotten out of the car, I'm sorry


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, I'm ready for anything
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who knows what the tide could bring?

I'm sorry for everything
But nobody knows what the tide could bring
You know, nobody knows what the tide could bring


Videotapes and ice skates are beautiful things
Like a pocket watch on Kelly Time and a pair of angel wings
Oh, and the birthday card to Johnny, it made me realize
That the most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the gift of life
The most beautiful thing in the world is to be so wonderfully alive
