Sons of Thunder:
We are the new sons of thunder
We are uncrushable diamonds of light
We are the daughters of wonder
And when we leave the Earth
With a shower of sparks
We'll meet in the sky and we'll walk among the stars

When we walk among the stars
The pleasure will be ours
And with young unbroken hearts
We'll walk among the stars
'Cause we belong
Above the heavens and beyond
Oh, wе are the odd music makers
Wе are the dreamers of unusual dreams
We all face the forces of nature
But bravely, we'll take great leaps of faith
And then just like that we'll walk upon the waves
'Cause we belong out on the ocean and beyond

We'll fly
We'll fly
We'll fly
(In the twinkling of an eye)
You and I, we'll fly


We are the heirs of adventure
And we are explorers of wondrous new worlds
We are the gifted inventors
And even though we are strange and exquisitely scarred
We won't need to pretend to be anything we aren't


When we walk among the stars
The pleasure will be ours
And with young unbroken hearts
We'll walk among the stars


Filled with the fierceness of tigers
We're all too familiar with the fires of life
But we are resilient survivors
And one day, we'll be free of nefarious schemes
Of cruel twists of fate and evil kings and queens
'Cause we belong between the sunrise and beyond

We'll fly
(In the twinkling of an eye)
We'll fly
We'll fly
(In the twinkling of an eye)
You and I, we'll fly


Sons of thunder, feel the wonder
You were made to run and not be faint
So take heart, wild one, for there is a God
Who loves you to death, no matter what you've done
So don't lose hope 'cause He will lead you home
Yeah, we serve a God
Who loves us to death, no matter what we've done
So don't lose hope 'cause He will lead us home


We'll fly
We'll fly
We'll fly
(In the twinkling of an eye)
You and I, we'll fly


When we walk among the stars
The pleasure will be ours (We'll fly)
And with young unbroken hearts
We'll walk among the stars (We'll fly)
