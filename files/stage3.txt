<p><center><u>Stage 3: XOR'ing Bits</u></center></p><br>
In the Stage3 folder of the ftp server, there are many files. Only three are relevant, and only two are required to complete the stage. 
<br><br>
One file contains the password to move onto the next stage, XOR'd with the contents of file two.
<br><br>
File three contains a short python utility that you may find helpful if you are unfamiliar with this manner of bit manipulation.
