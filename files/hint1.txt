Hint for stage 1:
<br><br>
This stage can be executed in three commands.
<br><br>
1. A cewl command using the -m and --lowercase tags.
<br><br>
2. A crunch command using the top three words of the previous output and the -p tag.
<br><br>
3. A hydra command with the username 'ayoung' and the output from the previous output.

Wouldn't it be convenient if there was a page that had the lyrics for ALL songs in the album?
