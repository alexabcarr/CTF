Hint for stage 2:
<br><br>
1. Using a utility, RECOVER any JPEGs from dinosaur-park.raw
<br><br>
2. (optional) Determine which image is relevant. The target image shares a theme with the .raw file :)
<br><br>
3. Examine the EXIF data for the (relevant) image. The password is the text in the 'description' field.
