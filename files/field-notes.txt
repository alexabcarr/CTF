Field Notes: 
We were heading on home, Diesel 'n me
Down an old gravel road way out in the country
Tuckered out after working the fields all day
When all of a sudden, off like a shot
That dog took off running, barkin' his head off
Wherever he went, he went like there was hell to pay


So lickety-split, I crashed through the fields
Chasin' after that hound and I was hot on his heels
When we both went over the edge of a deep ravinе
As I crawled up the bank cold and soaked to thе bone
A glint caught my eye from the mud where it shone
Something was buried there alongside the stream
Now the middle of a field is a pretty odd place to find
Some kind of trunk or a chest or a crate
But buried under the earth, I saw a corner exposed
No, there wasn't a map or a note or a key
It was clearly forgotten just waiting for me
Like I was supposed to find it there right under my nose

It had laid there for years, deep in the dirt
So I dug it out and wiped my hands on my shirt
I pried up the lid and excitedly peered inside
And what I saw was a sight to behold
'Cause that tattered old trunk was crammed full of gold
My eyes bugged out, it was enough to make a grown man cry
Big golden bricks with a shimmery sheen
They were a staggering sight to a poor boy like me
And right then and there, I knew what I had to do
So with a smile, I sold what little I had
I gave my pots and my pans to my mom and my dad
And then I bought that field
'Cause it was my dream come true


And then full of joy, I said goodbye to my shack
It wasn't much of a home so I never looked back
And I never questioned the choice I happily made
I said, "I need that field whatever it takes"
You might call it foolish but I call it faith
Trusting in God so gladly, you can hardly wait
And that's how I learned how a rich fella accounts
His treasure in heaven, not under the ground
'Cause betting the farm is well worth the risk
To carefully keep such a beautiful gift that's yours forever
It's a pretty good deal
There's a couple of things more precious than gold
One is your heart and the other's your soul
And you've got something you need that nobody can steal

It's a fable, you see and the moral is this
Your heart's with your treasure, wherever it is
And trust me when you dig, a treasure will be revealed
And you never know what could be buried in the middle of a field
