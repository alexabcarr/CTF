Vitamin Sea:
Mm-mm, do-do-do, ooh-ooh


I think highly of Hawaii
I got a cheap flight and a plan
So heads up, Nancy, don't get antsy
While I'm workin' on my tan


'Cause it's crystal clear to me
A weekend in Waikiki is what I need
Yeah, I could use a sip of island serenity
'Cause when I need a vacation
I need some vitamin sea

Aloha, let the good tides roll
Aloha and mahalo
When I walk on the beach
I never wanna leave
'Cause when I get kinda salty
I need some vitamin sea
Yeah, I gotta go now
'Cause I'm a little worn down
And I'm a little burned out
And I need a vacation
Aloha, let the good tides roll
'Cause when I get kinda salty
I need some vitamin sea


Mm-mm, do-do-do, ooh-ooh
Sitting calmly by a palm tree
With a lemonade in my hand
I ain't concerned if I sunburn
I'll catch all the rays I can


'Cause when my gusto gets low
Then that's when I know I have a tropical deficiency
And a little sand between my toes is the remedy
'Cause when I need a vacation
I need some vitamin sea

Aloha, let the good tides roll
Aloha and mahalo
When I walk on the beach
I never wanna leave
'Cause when I get kinda salty
I need some vitamin sea
Yeah, I gotta go now
'Cause I'm a little worn down
And I'm a little burned out
And I need a vacation
Aloha, let the good tides roll
'Cause when I get kinda salty
I need some vitamin sea


So B-R-B


I've gone coastal
'Cause when I feel a bit blue
I head for Honolulu
And I am happy as a clam
Mm-mm, do-do-do, ooh-ooh

So I'll put up my feet
And tell all my troubles to the ocean breeze
'Cause sitting on a beach is cheaper than therapy
And when I need a vacation
I think you'll know where I'll be

Aloha, let the good tides roll
Yeah, the voice of the ocean
It speaks to my soul
Where all my worries went
Well, I guess I don't know
So let the good tides roll

I need a vacation
'Cause I'm kinda low
Need a vacation

Yeah, I gotta go now
'Cause I'm a little worn down
And I'm a little burned out
And I need a vacation
Aloha, let the good tides roll
Aloha, let's go!
'Cause when I get kinda salty
I need some vitamin sea

Yeah (I need a vacation)
I need some vitamin sea
(I need a vacation)
Da-dada-dada-da-da-da
I'm on vacation
Da-dada-dada-da-da-da
And I think I'm gonna stay forever
Da-dada-dada-da-da-da
Yeah, I'm on vacation
Da-dada-dada-da-da-da
And I think I'm gonna stay forever
