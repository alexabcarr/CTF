[Verse 1]
Welcome to South Dakota
Here in early July
Tucked away in the Black Hills
On an especially starry night
A concrete green Brontosaurus
Has a subtle glint in her eye

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause under the moonlight
When the moment is right
Under the moonlight
Things come alive
[Chorus]
In Dinosaur Park, long after dark
I wonder what happens there
When no one's around
Does some kind of magic fill the air?
I won't ever prove statues can move
But I'd like to think they do
So I makе believe with all of my hеart
(Oh, oh)
There's magic afoot unseen in the dark
In Dinosaur Park

[Verse 2]
Boy, I love Rapid City
And that hilltop of beasts
When I gaze up at that T-rex
It's like he's staring back at me
Yeah, those old dinosaur sculptures
Fill my heart with awe and intrigue

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause under the moonlight
When the moment is right
Under the moonlight
Things come alive

[Chorus]
In Dinosaur Park, long after dark
I wonder what happens there
When no one's around
Does some kind of magic fill the air?
I won't ever prove statues can move
But I'd like to think they do
So I make believe with all of my heart
(Oh, oh)
There's magic afoot unseen in the dark
In Dinosaur Park

[Breakdown]
'Cause when the moon's sitting pretty above Rapid City
There's much more than meets the eye
And I can only imagine what strange things could happen
When nobody's on Skyline Drive
And when I leave Minnesota to see South Dakota
I got a lot of things on my mind
'Cause I can only imagine what strange things could happen
Up on top of that hill at night

[Bridge]
What do dinosaurs talk about
When they're alone?
Heh, before the sun comes up
And they turn back to stone
Do they look down on the city lights
Even though they don't bat an eye?
And then at night, when the moon is bright
Do they come alive?
I have a sneaking suspicion inside
[Chorus]
'Cause in Dinosaur Park, long after dark
I wonder what happens there
When no one's around
Does some kind of magic fill the air?
I won't ever prove statues can move
But I'd like to think they do
I don't know how, and I don't know why
(Oh, oh)
But I get the feeling deep down inside
(Oh, oh)
There's magic afoot in the middle of the night

[Breakdown]
'Cause when the moon's sitting pretty above Rapid City
There's much more than meets the eye
And I can only imagine what strange things could happen
When nobody's on Skyline Drive
And when I leave Minnesota to see South Dakota
I got a lot of things on my mind
'Cause I can only imagine what strange things could happen
Up on top of that hill at night

[Outro]
In Dinosaur Park
In Dinosaur Park
