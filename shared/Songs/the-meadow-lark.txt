[Verse 1]
Upon a winding forest road
I met a soldier far from home
I saw he was my enemy
So I aimed at him and he at me
Prepared was I, but loath to shoot
And he, uncertain what to do
A cold sweat formed upon my brow
But we both kept rank and stood our ground
And then, the curious thing occurred
On wings arrived a tiny bird
And troubled not by war or peace
She sang for us a melody
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I dared not move or look away
Lest my life, my foe would take
Yet in his eyes, I saw his fright
Just a boy like me afraid to die
The meadowlark sang on and on
Then morе arrived and joined the song
And as I hеld my rival stare
A tremendous chorus filled the air
Then in my heart, as clear as day
I heard a gentle whisper say
My son, if my disciple be
Show grace and love your enemy

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
With swell of birds sung all around
Lowered I my rifle down
And as my foe took aim at me
I showed him yield on bended knee
He faltered then and shook with fear
And from his eye, he wiped a tear
His gaze was as a brothers bond
And then, he turned and he was gone

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
If I should live to see more days
I pray the Lord to guide my ways
With grace to love my enemy
For grace, my Savior showed to me
With grace to love my enemy
For grace, my Savior showed to me
