[Verse 1]
I remember when I saw you at the movies
And to me, you were a stranger in the room
But to my surprise, I met your eyes and that was when I knew
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you
Yeah, without a doubt, I took you out for coffee
We sat for hours at a table made for two
And this is what I meant, sweet one I spent the whole day talking to
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you

[Chorus]
I love the lightness in your laughter and the sparkle in your eyes
It doesn't matter if it rains or shines 'cause I'll be by your side
You're the fire I admire and you'll always be my muse
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you
[Verse 2]
It was all a blur, then there we were at the altar
You were mine and all my dreams were coming true
You know I meant it when I took your hand in mine and said, "I do"
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you
But how the time does fly and years go by, it's crazy
We both got sick and hurt and sad a time or two
But how I love you more and more and after all that we've been through
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you

[Chorus]
I love the flowers in your footprints and the sparkle in your eyes
It doesn't matter if it rains or shines 'cause I'll be by your side
For the record, you're my treasure and you'll always be my muse
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you

[Bridge]
I'm not one to worry much about the future
But because you're mine, I got everything to lose
So I'll say it now before we're at the door that someday we'll walk through
And if I'm the only one left in the room
There's nowhere else I'll rather be than home with you

[Chorus]
I love the springtime in your spirit and the sparkle in your eyes
It doesn't matter if it rains or shines 'cause I'll be by your side
I can say it, you're my favorite and you'll always be my muse
And I hope that in your heart, you know it's true
There's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you
