[Verse 1]
I spent the summer in Santa Cruz
And I met a blonde on the beach with lots of quirky tattoos
She had that old movie quote, "We're gonna need a bigger boat"
Two tiny waves on her toes and turtle tracks on her collarbones

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked her what they meant
And this is what she said

[Chorus]
You gotta go with the flow 'cause the tides always turn
And sink or swim, divin' in is the best way to learn
Kick up the sand 'cause your tan proves you lived through the burn
And when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf
[Post-Chorus]
And by the way, it's okay, it could always bе worse
Yeah, when you wipе out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf

[Verse 2]
I met a blonde on the beach with lots of quirky tattoos
She had a shark on her arm, a pirate shreddin' the gnar
An octopus wearin' shades and seagull wings on her shoulder blades

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked her what they meant
And this is what she said

[Chorus]
You gotta go with the flow 'cause the tides always turn
And sink or swim, divin' in is the best way to learn
Kick up the sand 'cause your tan proves you lived through the burn
And when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf

[Post-Chorus]
And by the way, it's okay, it could always be worse
Yeah, when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf

(Go with the flow)
Then she said, "When you're sad and you feel alone
Write 'em down, all your worries and woes"
(Go with the flow)
"Then, fold 'em up, cork it shut and let that bottle go
And set your troubles afloat"

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
She told me, hey, "seas" the day, know the ocean by heart
And if it don't, float your boat, learn to swim with the sharks
Kick up the sand 'cause your tan proves you lived through the burn
And when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves
Yeah, when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf

[Outro]
Yeah!
(Learn how to surf)
And by the way, it's okay, it could always be worse
Yeah, when you wipe out, it's gonna hurt
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn how to surf
