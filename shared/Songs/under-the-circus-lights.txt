[Verse 1]
Once upon a summer
A travelling circus came to town
From the land down under
And I was filled with wonder
When I saw the girl on the flying trapeze
Tear through the air with the greatest of ease
I got cotton candy
And then in the daze, I met her gaze
And she winked right at me
And my heart pounded madly
When I saw the girl on the flying trapeze
Capture the crowd with the greatest of easе
[Chorus]
She was a light in a dark lullaby
That girl was raised by a butterfly
I swеar when I caught her eye, I could almost fly
And under the circus lights
I must have fallen in love that night

[Verse 2]
Lighter than a feather
But careful as with a heavy heart
She seemed to fall forever
And then I wondered whether
I noticed the girl on the flying trapeze
Blink back a tear with the greatest of ease
And she took my breath away
Oh, so grand and graceful
Confetti rained as she climbed through the air
Like a homesick angel
She makes heartache painful
I thought as the girl on the flying trapeze
Melted my heart with the greatest of ease

[Chorus]
What a display of rosé poetry
What a majestic menagerie
I swear when I caught her eye, I could almost fly
And under the circus lights
I must have fallen in love that night

[Bridge]
(And she took my breath away)
I was so enamored
(And she took my breath away)
All that glitz and glamor
(And she took my breath away)
I was so enamored
And that’s how the girl on the flying trapeze
Knocked me off my feet with the greatest of ease

[Verse 3]
And then with a charming sweetness
She smiled and waved and took a bow
For a crowd stunned speechless
And I was charmed to pieces
When the girl on the flying trapeze
Magically dissolved like a song on the breeze
And simply broke my heart with the greatest of ease

[Chorus]
We shook the floor with a roar of applause
She seemed to drown in the oohs and aahs
I hung around 'til the clowns
Tore the big top down
And soon it was almost dawn
I looked and looked but the girl was gone
[Outro]
Deep down, I felt kinda blue for a day or two
Then clear as a bell, I knew
I would run away with the circus too
